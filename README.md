Hi! I am a 41 year old father of three boys who decided it was time for a new direction in my life. I decided to obtain an AA degree at the local community colleges. That was in 2010. I am now one semester away from completing an MPH in Epidemiology. I am having a blast and can't wait for my next adventure.
